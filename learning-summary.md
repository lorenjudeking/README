## What I Learned  
- I was familiar with github before, but was not aware of the "fork" term, nor of its capabilities. It was an interesting read.  
- I can better understand control charts and their formulas besides of just looking and just saying that is that because it is.

## What Iâ€™m Still Confused About  
- It is safe to say I need to be more familar with branches and their purpose and when to use them.
